"Eyfel" = "The Eiffel Tower (la Tour Eiffel) ranks high on the list of places to visit in France and is the most-visited tourist attraction in the world. It's hard to believe that the structure was dismissed as a monstrosity when it was first unveiled. The iconic tower was designed by Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel for the Paris Exhibition of 1889, which marked the centenary of the French Revolution.

The tower consists of 18,000 sturdy iron sections (weighing over 10,000 tons) held together by 2.5 million rivets. This innovative structure is now considered a masterful architectural feat and is the most emblematic sight in Paris. Reaching 324 meters in height, the tower was the world's tallest building until the Empire State Building was erected.

For first-time visitors, seeing the Eiffel Tower is an unforgettable experience. Upon arrival at the esplanade (where the Information Desk is located), the sight of the four massive pillars that support this 10,100-ton monument leaves many awestruck.

To arrive at the first level (at 57 meters) requires an elevator ride or walk up the 360 steps. This level has public restrooms, a gift shop, cafeteria, brasserie restaurant, and outdoor space for admiring the views.

The second level (at 115 meters) of the Eiffel Tower is reached from the first level by a staircase of 344 more steps or an elevator ride. This level has similar amenities as the first level, except the viewing platforms offer a perspective onto more of the Paris monuments (such as Notre-Dame, the Louvre, and the Basilique du Sacré-Coeur), and this level has a fine-dining restaurant.

The Michelin-starred gastronomic restaurant, Le Jules Verne, delivers exquisite meals of refined contemporary French cuisine in a spectacular setting. The restaurant's dining rooms feature expansive windows, which provide a peak of the Eiffel Tower's structural beams and look out onto the cityscapes of Paris.

To reach the top level, at the dizzying elevation of 276 meters, requires an exhilarating elevator ride from the second level. Visiting the top level is one of the most thrilling things to do in Paris, but it's not for the faint of heart.

Tourists will want to spend some time snapping photos of Paris' most emblematic monument. From either the Jardins du Trocadéro (a short walk across the Seine River) or the Parc du Champ de Mars (the lawns in front of the tower), there is just the right distance for picture-perfect photo-ops.

Address: Tour Eiffel, Champ de Mars, 75007 Paris (Métro: Bir-Hakeim, Trocadéro, Iéna, or Passy station)";



"Luvr" = "A sumptuous palace that was once the home of France's kings, the Louvre is the most important of Paris' top museums. Visitors enter the museum in the courtyard of the palace at the glass pyramid (designed by Ieoh Ming Pei in 1917). The Louvre displays 35,000 artworks (many considered masterpieces) – from antiquities to European paintings of the 15th to 19th centuries.

It is impossible to see it all in one visit, but tourists can focus on a particular gallery, such as classical sculpture, Italian Renaissance art, or 17th-century French paintings, or take a self-guided tour to see the Louvre Museum's highlights.

The most famous piece is the Mona Lisa or La Gioconda (or La Joconde in French) painted by Leonardo da Vinci in 1503-1505. Many tourists breeze through the museum just to glance at this one piece, but there are many other must-see works of art to admire even if time is limited.

Among the top highlights of the Louvre are the ancient Venus de Milo sculpture; the monumental Victory of Samothrace of the Hellenistic period; the immense Wedding Feast at Cana painting by Veronese (1563); Botticelli's Young Lady with Venus and the Graces fresco; and Liberty Leading the People (1831) by Eugène Delacroix, depicting the Parisian uprising of July 1830.

To get the most out of a visit to the Louvre, tourists should join a guided tour. The Louvre Museum Skip the Line Tour takes participants straight to the museum's most famous artworks, including the Venus de Milo and the Mona Lisa. On this three-hour tour, a guide (who is an art historian) provides in-depth commentary about the masterpieces.

The Louvre is surrounded on one side by the Jardin des Tuileries, one of the loveliest parks in Paris. The celebrated landscape architect André Le Nôtre created the Tuileries Gardens in the formal French style of the 17th century, with perfectly manicured trees, statues, and pathways. Park benches and café-restaurants with outdoor seating invite visitors to relax and enjoy the scenery.

Address: Musée du Louvre, Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris (Métro: Palais-Royal Musée du Louvre or Pyramides station)";




"Notr-Dam" = "Notre-Dame stands in the heart of Paris on the Île-de-la-Cité next to the Latin Quarter. An island in the Seine River, the Île-de-la-Cité is the historical and geographical center of Paris. On this small plot of land, the Romans built the Gallo-Roman city of Lutetia, and from the 6th century to the 14th century, the Kings of France resided here.

The Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris was founded in 1163 by King Louis IX (Saint Louis) and Bishop Maurice de Sully, and the construction took more than 150 years. The cathedral was first created in Early Gothic style, while later additions (the west front and the nave) show the transition to High Gothic style.

This impressive medieval monument is a triumph of Gothic architecture. Tourists are immediately struck by the ornamental design of the facade, with its profusion of sculptures and gargoyles, while elaborate flying buttresses provide structural integrity for the enormous building.

Visitors should take a close look at the Gallery of Kings above the doorway on the elaborately detailed west facade. Rows of 28 intricately carved figures reveal representations of the French kings, from Childebert I (511-588) to Philippe Auguste. These figures lost their heads during the Revolution. (The heads are now on display in the Musée de Cluny.)

After admiring the decorative doorway, enter the sanctuary to take in the grandeur of this immense vaulted space. The sanctuary seems almost endless and beckons visitors with the light of flickering candles.

The interior is illuminated by magnificent stained-glass windows. The most noteworthy window is the rose window in the north transept. This stunning work of art features 80 Old Testament scenes centered around the Virgin.

Note: A large fire in April of 2019 caused considerable damage to the cathedral: The medieval roof and the 19th-century spire collapsed. The extent of the damage is still being assessed. At this time, the interior is closed to the public.

A project to stabilize and repair the structure is underway. The city plans to rebuild the cathedral and restore it to its previous state. The reopening is expected to take place in 2024.

Until the reopening, the Notre-Dame de Paris congregation will celebrate Mass at the Eglise Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois (2 Place du Louvre) in the 1st arrondissement.

Address: Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris, 6 Parvis Notre-Dame - Place Jean-Paul II, 75004 Paris (Métro: Cité or Saint-Michel Notre-Dame station)";




"Champs" = "The most monumental boulevard in Paris used to be a desolate field of marshland until the 17th century, when it was landscaped by André Le Nôtre. A century later, the Parisian city planner Baron Haussman designed the boulevard's elegant buildings. The Champs-Elysées is divided into two parts with the Rond-Point des Champs-Elysées as its intersection.

The lower part of the Champs-Elysées, bordering the Place du Concorde, includes a spacious park, the Jardin des Champs-Élysées, and the Petit Palais fine arts museum. The upper part, extending to the Arc de Triomphe, is lined by luxury shops, hotels, restaurants, cafés, cinemas, and theaters. This bustling area draws many tourists and is a gathering place for Parisians.

The Champs-Elysées is famous for its prestigious establishments, such as Maison Ladurée (75 Avenue des Champs-Elysées), a pâtisserie shop renowned for its 18th-century tea salon and delicious pastries (their specialty is macarons), and upscale designer boutiques like Tiffany & Co. (62 Avenue des Champs-Élysées), Louis-Vuitton (101 Avenue des Champs-Elysées), and Cartier (154 Avenue des Champs-Élysées).

For fine dining, the top choices are the legendary brasserie du luxe restaurant and hotel Le Fouquet's (99 Avenue des Champs-Élysées) and the swanky gastronomic restaurant L'Atelier Étoile de Joël Robuchon (133 Avenue des Champs Elysées), which has one Michelin star.

Although the Champs-Elysées has an image of refinement, there are many affordable places that cater to tourists and students on a budget, such as the Disney toy store, H&M clothing shop, Starbucks, Quick, Burger King, and McDonald's.

Address: Champs-Elysées, 75008 Paris (Métro: Champs-Élysées Clemenceau station to visit the Jardin des Champs-Élysées and Petit Palais, Franklin d. Roosevelt station for Laduree, George V station for the main shopping area).";






"Orsay" = "The Musée d'Orsay displays a splendid collection of 19th- and 20th-century art (created from 1848 to 1914) in the converted Gare d'Orsay. This Belle Epoque railway station was built for the Universal Exhibition of 1900.

Some of the world's most cherished paintings are on display in the museum's spacious galleries. The Orsay Museum is among the best places to visit in Paris to get an overview of Impressionist art history – from the gentle brush strokes of Monet to the wild, colorful scenes of Gauguin.

The collection represents the work of all the masters of Impressionism. The artists range from classic Impressionist masters Edgar Degas, Edouard Manet, Claude Monet, and Pierre-August Renoir to Post-Impressionist artists such as Pierre Bonnard, Paul Cézanne, and Vincent van Gogh; the Pointillists (Georges Seurat, Paul Signac); and Bohemian artists like Toulouse Lautrec.

Some of the museum's most famous pieces include Claude Monet's The Magpie, Gare Saint-Lazare, Poppy Field, and Luncheon on the Grass; Vincent van Gogh's self-portrait and Starry Night; and Renoir's Dance at Moulin de la Galette, which depicts a festive party scene in Montmartre.

The museum also has a bookstore and gift shop, two cafés, and a fine-dining restaurant, which is worth the splurge. Formerly the Hôtel d'Orsay (a luxury hotel within the original Gare d'Orsay) and listed as a Historic Monument, the museum's restaurant features gilded ceilings and sparkling chandeliers.

Address: Musée d'Orsay, 1 Rue de la Légion d'Honneur, 75007 Paris (Métro: Musée d'Orsay, Assemblée Nationale, or Solférino station)";





"Palais" = "Commissioned by Napoleon III in 1860, the Palais Garnier Opera House was designed by Charles Garnier in an exuberant Baroque style. Garnier worked tirelessly on the project for over a decade, from 1862 to 1875. Today, the opulent monument is a symbol of Napoleon's Imperial regime.

The facade features classical columns and eight sculptures representing allegorical figures: Poetry, Music, Idyll, Recitation, Song, Drama, and Dance. The loggia depicts busts of composers, including Rossini, Beethoven, and Mozart, while the cupola is topped with a statue of Apollo with allegorical figures of Poetry and Music.

Upon entering the building, visitors are dazzled by the lavish 11,000-square-meter interior. Most of the building's space is dedicated to the grand foyer with its fabulous Grand Escalier, marble entrance staircase, adorned by ornate gilded lamps.

The auditorium has an intimate feel, although it can accommodate 2,105 people in its plush red-velvet seats. Gilded balconies, an enormous crystal chandelier, and a Chagall ceiling painting add to the theater's marvelousness, creating the perfect dramatic backdrop for cultural performances.

For visitors looking for things to do at night in Paris, the Opéra Garnier hosts a prestigious calendar of events. Besides opera, there are ballet performances, classical music concerts, and gala events. Attending a performance is a wonderful way to see the building's interior and enjoy a glamorous evening. Another option is to visit (entry ticket required) or take a guided tour during the daytime.

The Bibliotèchque-Musée de l'Opera (Library-Museum of the Opera House) located inside the building contains three centuries of archives, as well as exhibits dedicated to the art of opera. The museum's permanent collection features drawings of costumes and scenery, scale models, and paintings of the building.

The Opera House also has a boutique that sells opera-related books and souvenirs. Connoisseurs of fine dining will be delighted to discover CoCo, a chic restaurant within the Opera House (entrance is on the Place Jacques-Rouché) that serves refined contemporary cuisine prepared from seasonal ingredients.

Address: Palais Garnier, Place de l'Opéra, 8 Rue Scribe (at Auber) 75009 Paris (Métro: Opéra, Chaussée d'Antin-La Fayette or Havre-Caumartin station)";





"Konkord" = "Created between 1755 and 1775 by the architect of King Louis XV, this impressive octagonal square is at the heart of 18th-century Paris. With its majestic dimensions, the Place de la Concorde is one of the most attractive squares in the city. It was the scene of several key historical events, including the execution of King Louis XVI, and it was part of Napoleon's triumphal route.

The square offers sensational views of the triumphal route towards the Arc de Triomphe and the Défense, and towards the Louvre, as well as to the Madeleine and the Palais-Bourbon. At the center is an Egyptian obelisk, which was presented to Charles X by the Viceroy of Egypt. During summer, there is a Ferris wheel here.

The Place de la Concorde is a busy intersection with heavy traffic, circulating at high speeds. French drivers don't always pay attention to pedestrians, so tourists should make sure to get out of the way!

To arrive at the Place de la Concorde, walk from the Louvre through the Jardin du Tuileries or the Rue du Rivoli, or follow the Quai along the Seine River. Alternatively take the Métro to Concorde station.";






"Arc" = "The Arc de Triomphe is dedicated to the soldiers who fought in the French armies of the Revolution and the First Empire (Napoleonic Wars). Napoleon commissioned the building of this mighty structure in 1806 but did not live to see its completion in 1836.

Designed by architect Jean François Chalgrin, who was inspired by the Arch of Titus in Rome, the massive 50-meter-high arch features bas-reliefs with larger-than-life-size figures, which depict the departure, victories, and glorious return of the French armies.

Particularly noteworthy is the bas-relief by François Rude on the Champs-Elysées-facing side: Departure of the Volunteers of 1792, also known as The Marseillaise, illustrating the troops led by the winged spirit of Liberty. On the inner surface of the arch are the names of more than 660 generals and more than a hundred battles.

From the top of the monument, a viewing platform affords panoramic views of the 12 avenues that radiate from the Place de l'Etoile, including the route from the Champs-Elysées to Place de la Concorde and the Louvre. It's possible to see all the way to La Défense, Montmartre, and the Eiffel Tower.

At the foot of the Arc de Triomphe is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, dedicated in 1921 as a memorial to an anonymous soldier (symbol of the many other unknown soldiers who valiantly died for their country during World War One without ever receiving recognition).

The Flame of Remembrance was ignited at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on November 11th, 1923 and since that date has not ever been extinguished. Every evening at 6:30pm, a ritual takes place to rekindle the memorial flame at the tomb.

Today, events to honor national holidays are held at the Arc de Triomphe, including the November 11th (anniversary of the Armistice of 1918) ceremony commemorating those who perished in the war; the May 8th Fête de la Victoire (Victory Day) celebrating the end of WWII, and the liberation from Nazi occupation; as well as festivities for July 14th (Bastille Day).

The monument staff provides guided tours in French every day at 10:30am; these tours are included in the price of the admission ticket. The site also has documentation and multi-media presentations in multiple languages.

Tourists will appreciate the gift shop and bookstore at the Arc de Triomphe. For visitors with reduced mobility and young children, there is an elevator to reach the viewing platform. Otherwise, visitors must take the stairs.

Address: Arc de Triomphe, Place Charles de Gaulle, 75008 Paris (Métro: Charles de Gaulle-Étoile, Kléber or Argentine station)";






"Sena" = "A boat cruise along the Seine River is one of the best ways to soak up the alluring scenery of Paris. Seine River Cruises allow tourists to see the sights from a different perspective. The Seine River bridges, Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum look stunning from the viewpoint of a riverboat.

While a daytime cruise allows tourists to appreciate the glory of the monuments brightened by sunshine, the most romantic experience is an evening cruise. After sunset, the city's landmarks are illuminated, which creates a special effect, and somehow the city seems more magical.

For a cruise that includes dinner, try the Bateaux Parisiens Seine River Gourmet Dinner & Sightseeing Cruise. This luxurious riverboat cruise departs at the Port de la Bourdonnais (near the Eiffel Tower), and guests are treated to a gourmet three-course meal.";
